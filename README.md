# Sign Language Recognition using YOLOv5

Hello! I just finished my little project as a student.  
This project is about recognizing sign language using object detection.  
I used [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) as the core model for detection.

## Project Details
- **Model:** YOLOv5
- **Framework:** PyTorch
- **Purpose:** Recognize hand gestures for sign language.
- **Status:** Completed basic functionality.

Have a good day! ^^
